# RinBot
My first JavaScript (well now TypeScript) project that kickstarted my programming hobby.


RinBot was the first bot that I ever wrote, and basically what got me into programming in the first place. Granted, a lot of the code was written when I was first starting out, so it's very much a mess. I would re-write it, but the code is too far gone, and I would much rather re-write it in Java, so this bot is archived, as it'll be replaced with its Java counterpart.
