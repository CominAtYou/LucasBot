# LucasBot
Some dumb bot I made because my friend wouldn't stop making puns out of my username

### To set up the bot
First, clone the repo:


`$ git clone https://github.com/CominAtYou/LucasBot`


Then, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).


After that, navigate to the repo you cloned earlier:


`$ cd <PATH/TO/REPO>`


Then, initalize node:


`$ npm init`


Fill out the fields that are presented to you, or press enter for each one to skip this step.





Then, open up index.js and fill in your bot token in the nessecary fields, and make changes to what the bot says and does.


Finally, to run the bot:


`$ npm start`
