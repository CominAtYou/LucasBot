# LucasBot
Some dumb bot I made because my friend wouldn't stop making puns out of my username

This project is free to be modified in any way, as long as I recieve credit if it is publicly published.

### To set up the bot
First, clone the repo:
`$ git clone https://github.com/CominAtYou/LucasBot`
Then, install [node.js](nodejs.org).
After that, navigate to the repo you cloned earlier:
`$ cd <PATH/TO/REPO>`
Then, initalize node:
`$ npm install`
Then, open up index.js and fill in your token and bot logins.
Finally, to run the bot:
`npm start`
