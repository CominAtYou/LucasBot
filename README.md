# LucasBot
Some dumb bot I made because my friend wouldn't stop making puns out of my username

### To set up the bot
First, clone the repo:


`$ git clone https://github.com/CominAtYou/LucasBot`


Then, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).


Now, we need to tell Discord you're making a bot.


 - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers) and click 'New Application', and name it.


 - Click "Bot" in the side panel, and then click "Add Bot", and confirm.


 - Change your bot's name and picture (if you want), and copy its token.


After that, navigate to the repo you cloned earlier:


`$ cd <PATH/TO/REPO>`


Then, initalize node:


`$ npm init`


Fill out the fields that are presented to you, or press enter for each one to skip this step.


Import the discord.js library to the project:


`$ npm install discord.js --save`


Then, open up index.js and fill in your bot token in the nessecary fields, and make changes to what the bot says and does.


Finally, to run the bot:


`$ npm start`
